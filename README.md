## Questions

1. Q: Why not just write this in React as a webapp, like:  
   https://youtu.be/oMKOtYQljM4  
   A: Because I want to:
   1. ... also control it via a watch
   2. ... better work with bluetooth headsets

## TODOs
(Not necessarily in any order)
1. `Wear` version (will involve moving some stuff to `Common`)
2. Get `Reset` button working
3. Add `text` input/output feature
4. Get `Conversation/Transcription` enhancements

## Development
* If Mobile or Wear physical device wireless debugging does not connect:
  (from https://youtu.be/lLUYPdaf_Ow)
   1. `adb pair a.b.c.d:12345`
   2. `adb connect a.b.c.d:54321`
